# Count-the-Number-of-Vowels-in-a-String
Write a Java program that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in it. The program should be case-insensitive.

Explanation:
Converts the input to lowercase to handle case-insensitivity.

Loops through each character and increments a counter if it's a vowel.

Simple yet effective string processing problem.
